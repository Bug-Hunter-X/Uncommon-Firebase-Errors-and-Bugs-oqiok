The solutions involve addressing the root causes: Verifying Firebase project setup and the `google-services.json` file's integrity. Ensuring network connectivity, and implementing proper error handling and retry mechanisms. For offline scenarios, leverage Firebase's offline persistence features and use transactions or server timestamps to resolve conflicts.  Always handle asynchronous operations using Promises or async/await to avoid race conditions and ensure proper sequencing of events.
