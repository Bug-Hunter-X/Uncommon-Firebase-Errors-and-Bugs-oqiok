The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the app's configuration is incorrect or if there are network issues. For example, if the Firebase project is not properly set up or if the app's `google-services.json` file is missing or outdated, the SDK may fail to initialize correctly.  Another issue is when dealing with offline capabilities. If you're not properly handling offline data persistence and synchronization, conflicts can occur leading to unexpected data loss or corruption.  In asynchronous operations, not properly handling promises or callbacks can lead to race conditions.
